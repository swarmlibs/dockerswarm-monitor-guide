## Architecture Overview
This is the architecture overview of the whole system working together.

We are using the Grafana Labsâ€™ opinionated observability stack which includes: Loki-for logs, Grafana - for dashboards and visualization, Tempo - for traces, and Mimir - for metrics.

## Stacks

These are the components that will be instrumented to gather Metrics, Logs and Traces.

- [promstack](https://github.com/swarmlibs/promstack): A Docker Stack deployment for the monitoring suite for Docker Swarm includes (Grafana, Prometheus, cAdvisor, Node exporter and Blackbox prober exporter)
- [logstack](https://github.com/swarmlibs/logstack): Like Promstack, but for logs. Includes (Grafana Loki and Promtail)

### Promstack

A Docker Stack deployment for the monitoring suite for Docker Swarm includes (Grafana, Prometheus, Promtail, cAdvisor, Node exporter and Blackbox prober exporter)

- Automatically discover and scrape the metrics from the Docker Swarm nodes, services and tasks.
- Ability to configure scrape target via Docker object labels.
- Dynamically inject scrape configs from Docker configs.
- Automatically reload the Prometheus configuration when the Docker configs are create/update/remove.

The dynamic scrape configs are provided by the [swarmlibs/prometheus-configs-provider](https://github.com/swarmlibs/prometheus-configs-provider) service. And with the help of the [prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator/tree/main/cmd/prometheus-config-reloader](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator/tree/main/cmd/prometheus-config-reloader) tool, we can automatically reload the Prometheus configuration when the Docker configs are create/update/remove.

## Pre-requisites

- Docker running Swarm mode
- A Docker Swarm cluster with at least 3 nodes
- Configure Docker daemon to expose metrics for Prometheus

## Configure the Docker daemon to expose metrics for Prometheus

To configure the Docker daemon as a Prometheus target, you need to specify the metrics-address in the daemon.json configuration file. This daemon expects the file to be located at one of the following locations by default. If the file doesn't exist, create it.

* **Linux**: `/etc/docker/daemon.json`
* **Docker Desktop**: Open the Docker Desktop settings and select Docker Engine to edit the file.

Add the following configuration:

```json
{
  "metrics-addr": "0.0.0.0:9323"
}
```

Save the file, or in the case of Docker Desktop for Mac or Docker Desktop for Windows, save the configuration. Restart Docker.

The Docker Engine now exposes Prometheus-compatible metrics on port `9323` on all interfaces. For more information on configuring the Docker daemon, see the [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/config/daemon/prometheus/).
